We started this website because we love technology. I have a PhD in Computer Science, and my partner is a Linux expert. Our mission is to bring you the how-to information you crave. That's how our blog got its name! We want to be your authoritative source for tech "how-to" articles.

Starting small is not a problem. When reviewing niches for blogs, we both realized that technology was our passion. We love what we do. That's why we're committed to giving you the very best of how-to tutorials, with a focus on step-by-step, end-to-end instructions.

Our passion for technology drove us to do intensive research on the kind of articles you want and gave us the drive to put in the hard work needed to turn our inspiration into a sizzling blog. We serve visitors from all over the world, and we're thrilled to be a part of the human side of the technology industry. We hope you enjoy reading our posts as much as we enjoy creating them for you.

We live in the United States, but our background is pretty international. I was born in South Africa, my partner was born in Texas, and we met in England. We travel as much as we can, and we share our technology tips on this site. We regularly publish content about new technology as we learn about it. We're always at the leading edge!

Thanks for checking out our website!
