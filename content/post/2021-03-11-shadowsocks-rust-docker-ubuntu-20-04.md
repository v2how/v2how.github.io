### Introduction

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create your own Shadowsocks server on an Ubuntu 20.04 platform using Docker.

The server you'll build will implement the authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`. You'll test your server with the Shadowsocks for Windows graphical user interface (GUI) client.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working and tested Shadowsocks server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you will need a virtual private server (VPS) running Ubuntu 20.04. You can rent servers from companies such as [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) or [Bandwagon Host](https://bandwagonhost.com). You do not need a domain name for the server in this tutorial.

## Step 1 — Logging In as Root

SSH into your server. On Linux and macOS, you can use the terminal command `ssh` to reach your server. On Windows, you can either use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) or a graphical user interface (GUI) such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty) or [XSHELL](https://www.netsarang.com).

If you're not logged in as `root`, then become `root` as follows. If you don't already know the root password, then set it by issuing the command:

```bash
sudo passwd root
```

The `sudo` command allows non-root users to issue root commands. The `passwd` command allows you to set the password for yourself or another user, which in this case is the user named `root`.

You are prompted to enter your own password:

```bash
[sudo] password for amy:
```

Enter your own (non-root) password.

You are then prompted to enter a new password for the user `root`:

```bash
New password:
```

Choose and enter the new password for `root`.

You are prompted to confirm the new password by retyping it:

```bash
Retype new password:
```

Enter the same new password for `root`.

If all is well, you will receive a feedback message:

```bash
passwd: password updated successfully
```

Now you know the root password, become `root`:

```bash
su -
```

The `su` command (short for switch user) allows you to switch to another user id, so that you can run commands with that user's privileges. Since no specific user is named, you will by default switch to the user `root`.  The hyphen (`-`) means create a new login environment for the new user, which will be completely separate from your existing login environment.

You are prompted to enter the password for `root` that you set a few moments ago:

```bash
Password:
```

Enter the root password.

You will notice that your command prompt changes from a dollar sign to a hash sign:

```bash
#
```

This is a reminder that your are logged in as `root`. Now that you are `root`, you do not need to prefix privileged commands with `sudo`.

Update your package lists, and upgrade all your packages to the latest version:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

You will see package upgrade messages in your terminal.

## Step 2 — Generating a Random Port Number

Your Shadowsocks server will use a random port for its input. Generate a random number between 1024 and 65535 for your Shadowsocks port number.

```bash
shuf -i 1024-65535 -n 1
```

The `shuf` command generates random permutations. `-i` specifies an input range, and `-n` is the number of lines of output required. We will use the following example in the rest of this tutorial:

```
25117
```

Make a note of this number, as you will need it on both the server and the client.

## Step 3 — Enabling the Firewall (Optional)

We recommend that you protect your server and especially port `22` (the SSH port) by installing a firewall. In this tutorial, you'll install and configure the uncomplicated firewall (`ufw`).

On many Ubuntu systems, `ufw` is already installed. Check that `ufw` is installed on your system:

```bash
apt list ufw
```

You should see a message:

```bash
ufw/focal,now 0.36-6 all [installed]
```

If you do not see the message stating that `ufw` is already installed, then install the software package now:

```bash
apt install ufw
```

Now you'll set up the firewall. If you can guarantee that you will always SSH into your server from a single IP address, then limit SSH access to just that single address. For example, if your IP address is `51.51.51.51`, then issue the command: 

```bash
ufw allow from 51.51.51.51/32 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

When you execute that command, you will see a message:

```bash
Rules updated
```

If limiting access to a single IP address is not possible, but you can guarantee you will always connect from a known IP address range, then limit SSH access to just that range. For example, if you are in an office which always uses the IP address range `51.51.51.0/24`, then issue the command:

```bash
ufw allow from 51.51.51.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

If limiting access to an IP address range is not possible, then you will have to open the SSH port for access from the entire world:

```bash
ufw allow ssh
```

In any case, we recommend that you further protect port `22` by using SSH key authentication in preference to password authentication. SSH key pair generation and upload to your server are out of scope for this tutorial. You can find tutorials on this subject on the web.

Open your Shadowsocks port, which in our example is `25117`.

```bash
ufw allow 25117/tcp
ufw allow 25117/udp
```

Enable UFW:

```bash
ufw enable
```

You will see a warning message:

```bash
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
```

Type `Y` and press `ENTER` to confirm that you wish to enable `ufw`. You will see a message:

```bash
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
```

Check the status of your firewall:

```bash
ufw status
```

You will see a firewall status display that looks like the following:

```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       51.51.51.0/24
25117/tcp                  ALLOW       Anywhere
25117/udp                  ALLOW       Anywhere
25117/tcp (v6)             ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
25117/udp (v6)             ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

If your VPS provider implements the concept of security groups, you will also need to open your security group assignments for these posrts in your provider's control panel.

## Step 4 — Generating a Strong Password

You need to generate a strong password to protect your server. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal session with your server:

```bash
< /dev/urandom tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 16; echo;
```

The special file `/dev/urandom` on Linux systems provides an interface to the kernel's pseudorandom number generator. The contents of `/dev/urandom` become input to `tr`. The `tr` command is a command-line utility for translating or deleting characters. `-d` means delete and `-c` means complement, so `-dc` means delete any characters that are *not* in the set `A` through `Z`, `a` through `z`, and `0` through `9`. 

The output, now alphanumeric only, is piped into `head`. The `head` command is a command-line utility for outputting the first part of a file given to it via standard input. The `-c` switch limits the number of characters. The operand `16` is the number of characters you want.

Finally, the `echo` command echoes back input to the terminal, which in this case just gives you a new line after the display of your password.

Here is the sample output. You will see this example used in the rest of this tutorial:

```
25u4kC4XbIWZJ75Q
```

Copy your generated password. Open a text editor on your PC . Paste the password into your text editor. 

You will need this password on both your server and your client when you run Shadowsocks.

## Step 5 — Installing Docker

Now you'll install Docker on your server.

Install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

Add Docker’s official GPG key:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the Docker stable repository:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

The file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list` now contains the Docker repository. Update your package lists accordingly:

```bash
apt update
```

Install Docker:

```bash
apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should see messages:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
b8dfde127a29: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:308866a43596e83578c7dfa15e27a73011bdd402185a84c5cd7f32a88b501a24
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Step 6 — Pulling the Image

Pull Teddysun's Docker image for Shadowsocks-Rust by issuing the command:

```bash
docker pull teddysun/shadowsocks-rust
```

You will see messages that look like the following:

```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from teddysun/shadowsocks-rust
45b42c59be33: Pull complete
f50629ee3cc4: Pull complete
b270b750cfe4: Pull complete

Digest: sha256:4d79f0f64c397e5beb82661367449eeb3ab27022fd0c10581f13f55056973ea4
Status: Downloaded newer image for teddysun/shadowsocks-rust:latest
docker.io/teddysun/shadowsocks-rust:latest
```

## Step 7 — Configuring Shadowsocks

Now you'll create your Shadowsocks configuration file on the server.

Make a directory in `/etc` named `/shadowsocks-rust`:

```bash
mkdir /etc/shadowsocks-rust
```

Create a configuration file `/etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json` using the example below as a template. Before you use the example:

- Replace `25117` by your choice of random port number
- Replace `25u4kC4XbIWZJ75Q` by your choice of strong password
- Replace `chacha20-ietf-poly1305` by your choice of cipher, but make sure you use an AEAD cipher

```
cat > /etc/shadowsocks-rust/config.json <<EOF
{
    "server":"0.0.0.0",
    "server_port":25117,
    "password":"25u4kC4XbIWZJ75Q",
    "timeout":300,
    "method":"chacha20-ietf-poly1305",
    "nameserver":"8.8.8.8",
    "mode":"tcp_and_udp"
}
EOF
```

## Step 8 — Running the Container

Run the command that follows, replacing `25117` in all four places by your choice of port number:

```bash
docker run -d -p 25117:25117 -p 25117:25117/udp --name ss-rust --restart=always -v /etc/shadowsocks-rust:/etc/shadowsocks-rust teddysun/shadowsocks-rust
```

The `-d` option means run detached. The `-p` option specifies exposed ports.  The `-v` option gives the volumes.

## Step 9 — Testing with Windows Client

Now work on your PC.

Download the most recent release of the Windows client from https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases.

![Shadowsocks for Windows zip file](/images/shadowsocks-windows-zip.png)

Unzip the `zip` file.

![Shadowsocks for Windows unzipped](/images/shadowsocks-unzipped.png)

Double-click on the application `shadowsocks.exe` to launch the Shadowsocks for Windows client. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears, click **More info** then **Run anyway**. 

Enter client parameters that match the configuration you specified on your server:

- Enter your actual **Server IP** address
- Enter your choice of Shadowsocks **Server Port** number, which is `25117` in our example
- Enter your choice of **Password**, which is `25u4kC4XbIWZJ75Q` in our example
- Select your choice of **Encryption** cipher, which is `chacha20-ietf-poly1305` in our example

Click **Apply**. Clich **OK**.

![Shadowsocks Edit Servers](/images/shadowsocks-edit-servers.png)

A notification appears to say that Shadowsocks is connected.

![Shadowsocks is connected](/images/shadowsocks-is-here.png)

Right-click on the Shadowsocks paper airplane icon in the system tray. This brings up the context menu. Select **System Proxy**. Make sure you are in **Global** mode. 

![Shadowsocks Global mode](/images/shadowsocks-global-mode.png)

In your browser, visit https://www.iplocation.net to confirm that your web browsing is now coming from your server location.

When you have finished browsing, **Quit** Shadowsocks from the context menu.

## Conclusion

You now have a working Shadowsocks server that you've tested with the Windows client.
