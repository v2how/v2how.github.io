### Introduction

Brook is a cross-platform proxy server and client that provides strong encryption and resistance to detection. 

The design philosopy of Brook is to keep it simple. There are no complicated configuration files, and you can run Brook as a daemon without systemd.

In this tutorial you'll see how to run a Brook server on Ubuntu 20.04 and how to test your server with a Brook client, also running on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you will need:

- A virtual private server (VPS) running Ubuntu 20.04. You can rent servers from providers such as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) or [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com).
- Your own domain name, which may be [free](https://www.freenom.com) or [paid](https://www.namesilo.com). In the rest of this tutorial, we use `domain.com` as the sample domain name and `fq.domain.com` as the fully qualified domain name allocated to your server.
- A DNS type `A` record pointing from the fully qualified domain name of your server to the server's IP address. Usually you set up the DNS record at your domain name registrar. You can also set up DNS records elsewhere, such as at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). If you are using Cloudflare, note that some Xray configurations require DNS services only and will not work with proxying.

## Step 1 — Logging In as Root

SSH into your server. On Linux and macOS, you can use the terminal command `ssh` to reach your server. If you run Windows on your workstation, you can either use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) or a graphical user interface (GUI) such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty) or [XSHELL](https://www.netsarang.com).

If you're not logged in as `root`, then become `root` as follows. If you don't already know the root password, then set the root password by issuing the command:

```bash
sudo passwd root
```

The `sudo` command allows non-root users to issue root commands. The `passwd` command allows you to set the password for yourself or another user, which in this case is the user named `root`.

You are prompted to enter your own password:

```bash
[sudo] password for amy:
```

Enter your own (non-root) password.

You are then prompted to enter a new password for the user `root`:

```bash
New password:
```

Choose and enter the new password for `root`.

You are prompted to confirm the new password by retyping it:

```bash
Retype new password:
```

Enter the same new password for `root`.

If all is well, you will receive a feedback message:

```bash
passwd: password updated successfully
```

Now you know the root password, become `root`:

```bash
su -
```

The `su` command (short for switch user) allows you to switch to another user id, so that you can run commands with that user's privileges. Since no specific user is named, you will by default switch to the user `root`.  The hyphen (`-`) means create a new login environment for the new user, which will be completely separate from your existing login environment.

You are prompted to enter the password for `root` that you set a few moments ago:

```bash
Password:
```

Enter the root password.

You will notice that your command prompt changes from a dollar sign to a hash sign:

```bash
#
```

This is a reminder that your are logged in as `root`. Now that you are `root`, you do not need to prefix privileged commands with `sudo`.

Update your package lists, and upgrade all your packages to the latest version:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

You will see package upgrade messages in your terminal.

## Step 2 — Enabling the Firewall (Optional)

We recommend that you protect your server and especially port `22` (the SSH port) by installing a firewall. In this tutorial, you'll install and configure the uncomplicated firewall (`ufw`).

On many Ubuntu systems, `ufw` is already installed. Check that `ufw` is installed on your system:

```bash
apt list ufw
```

You should see a message:

```bash
ufw/focal,now 0.36-6 all [installed]
```

If you do not see the message stating that `ufw` is already installed, then install the software package now:

```bash
apt install ufw
```

Now you'll set up the firewall. If you can guarantee that you will always SSH into your server from a single IP address, then limit SSH access to just that single address. For example, if your IP address is `12.12.12.12`, then issue the command: 

```bash
ufw allow from 12.12.12.12/32 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

When you execute that command, you will see a message:

```bash
Rule added
```

If limiting access to a single IP address is not possible, but you can guarantee you will always connect from a known IP address range, then limit SSH access to just that range. For example, if you are in an office which always uses the IP address range `12.12.12.0/24`, then issue the command:

```bash
ufw allow from 12.12.12.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

If limiting access to an IP address range is not possible, then you will have to open the SSH port for access from the entire world:

```bash
ufw allow ssh
```

In any case, we recommend that you further protect port `22` by using SSH key authentication in preference to password authentication. SSH key pair generation and upload to your server are out of scope for this tutorial. You can find tutorials on this subject on the web.

Open ports `80` (the HTTP port) and `443` (the HTTPS port). These will be used for Xray and for the Nginx camouflage website:

```bash
ufw allow http
ufw allow https
```

Enable UFW:

```bash
ufw enable
```

You will see a warning message:

```bash
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
```

Type `Y` and press `ENTER` to confirm that you wish to enable `ufw`. You will see a message:

```bash
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
```

Check the status of your firewall:

```bash
ufw status
```

You will see a firewall status display that looks like the following:

```bash
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       12.12.12.0/24
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
443/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

If your VPS provider implements the concept of security groups, you will also need to open your security group assignments for ports 22, 80, and 443 in their control panel.

## Step 3 — Generating a Strong Password

You need to generate a strong password to protect your server. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal session with your server:

```bash
< /dev/urandom tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 16; echo;
```

The special file `/dev/urandom` on Linux systems provides an interface to the kernel's pseudorandom number generator. 

The contents of `/dev/urandom` become input to `tr`. The `tr` command is a command-line utility for translating or deleting characters. `-d` means delete and `-c` means complement, so `-dc` means delete any characters that are *not* in the set `A` through `Z`, `a` through `z`, and `0` through `9`. 

The output, now alphanumeric only, is piped into `head`. The `head` command is a command-line utility for outputting the first part of a file given to it via standard input. The `-c` switch limits the number of characters. The operand `16` is the number of characters you want.

Finally, the `echo` command echoes back input to the terminal, which in this case just gives you a new line after the display of your password.

Here is the sample output. You will see this example used in the rest of this tutorial:

```
RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v
```

In your terminal emulator, copy your generated password. Open a text editor such as `gedit` on your PC . Paste the password into your text editor. 

You will need this password on both your server and your client when you run Brook on them.

## Step 4 — Downloading Brook to Your Server

Still on your PC, open a browser. Visit the page https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases. Determine the location of the latest release of Brook for 64-bit Linux. We will use as an example `https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases/download/v20210214/brook_linux_amd64`.

In your terminal session with your server, download the binary for latest release of Brook. Using our file location example, your command would be:

```
curl -L https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases/download/v20210214/brook_linux_amd64 -o /usr/bin/brook
```

`curl` gets the file. `-L` allows for location switching. The `-o` switch directs the output of `curl` to the `/usr/bin` directory, which should be in your execution path.

You will see feeback on the download size and speed. For example:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   623    0   623    0     0   3331      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  3331
100 10.8M  100 10.8M    0     0  20.3M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 20.3M
```

Make the binary executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/bin/brook
```

## Step 5 — Running Brook on Your Server

In the examples in this tutorial, we are using Brook in WebSocket Secure (WSS) mode. WebSocket works over HTTP ports `443` and `80` and supports HTTP proxies and intermediaries, so it is fully compatible with the HTTP protocol. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket protocol uses the HTTP `Upgrade` header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

Before you go any further, ensure your prerequisites are complete. Make sure your fully qualified domain name can be successfully resolved, and ports `80` and `443` on your server are open.

Then issue the following command, replacing `fq.domain.com` by the fully qualified domain name of your server, and replacing `RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v` by your generated strong password:

```bash
brook wssserver --domain fq.domain.com -p RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v
```

Wait for Brook to start. Brook will automatically request an SSL certificate for you. It listens on port `443`.

There is no message on the terminal.

Leave the terminal open, with Brook running on the command line.

## Step 6 — Downloading Brook on Your Client

Now go back to working on your PC. The first step, downloading the client, is similar to the equivalent step on the server.

Open a browser. Visit the page https://github.com/txthinking/brook/releases. Determine the latest release of Brook for 64-bit Linux.

Download the executable. By default your browser will put it into your `~/Downloads` directory. It will have a name like `brook_linux_amd64`.

Open a second terminal session on your client (i.e, leave Brook running on the server in the first terminal session). 

Copy the download into your `/usr/bin` directory, which should be in your execution path:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Downloads/brook_linux_amd64 /usr/bin/brook
```

We prefix the `cp` (copy) command by `sudo` because we assume you are running as a non-root user on your client PC.

Make the binary executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/brook
```

## Step 7 — Running Brook on Your Client

Still in a teminal on your client, issue the following command. Replace `fq.domain.com` by the fully qualified domain name of your server, and replace `RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v` by your choice of strong password:

```bash
brook wssclient -s wss://fq.domain.com:443 -p RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080
```

Also leave the second terminal window open, with the Brook client running in it.

![Brook wssclient running in an Ubuntu Linux terminal emulator](/images/brook-wssclient.png)

The Brook WSS client is now listening on `127.0.0.1` port `1080`.

## Step 8 — Configuring Firefox to Use Brook

Open Firefox. From the hamburger menu, select **Preferences**. In the **Network Settings** section, click **Settings**. Set the network settings as follows:

- Select the radio button for **Manual proxy configuration**
- Fill in `127.0.0.1` in SOCKS Host
- Fill in `1080` in the Port
- Select the radio button for **SOCKS v5**
- Check the box **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5**
- Click **OK**

![Firefox Network Settings for Manual proxy configuration](/images/firefox-manual-proxy.png)

Firefox now sends requests to the Brook client, which in turn transmits them to the Brook server. 

Do an end-to end test by visiting a site such as https://ipchicken.com. If everything is working properly, you will see the IP address of your server, not your client PC.

## Step 9 — (Optional) Running Brook on Your Server as a Daemon

This tutorial follows the recommened setup order of running the Brook command directly first, to make sure there are no errors, before running it with `joker`. As a final step, you can optionally run Brook under `joker`.

Go back to your first terminal session, the one where you are SSH-ing into your server. 

On the server, stop Brook running by pressing **CTRL**+**C** on your computer keyboard.

You will see a message such as:

```
^C2021/02/26 16:21:49 http: Server closed
```

Now download and install `nami`. `nami` is a decentralized binary package manager.

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/getnami | bash && sleep 6 && exec -l $SHELL
```

As before, `curl` is the command-line utility for transferring data to or from a server. In this case, the script location is `https://git.io/getnami`. The `-L` switch allows for possible changes of location. 

The downloaded script is piped into `bash`, the Bourne Again SHell. We then allow a 6-second pause for the script to run. The `exec` command executes the script, with `-1` meaning positional parameter number 1. `$SHELL` means the user's shell, as specified by the password database.

You will see feedback messages that look like this:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   624  100   624    0     0   3851      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  3875
100 11.5M  100 11.5M    0     0  12.9M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 44.0M
+-------------------+----------------------------+
| Package           | github.com/txthinking/nami |
|                   |                            |
| Installed Version | v20201101                  |
| Installed Files   | nami                       |
+-------------------+----------------------------+
```

`nami` is installed into your user's `.nami/bin` directory, and `.nami/bin` is added to your execution path.

Use `nami` to download and run `joker`. `joker` is a simple, small, clean, zero-configuration tool for turning processes into daemons. Joker does not depend on systemd.

```bash
nami install github.com/txthinking/joker
```

You will see feedback messages that look like this:

```
+-------------------+-----------------------------+
| Package           | github.com/txthinking/joker |
|                   |                             |
| Installed Version | v20200902                   |
| Installed Files   | joker                       |
+-------------------+-----------------------------+
```

Now on you server you can run Brook under `joker`. Issue the following command, replacing `fq.domain.com` by the fully qualified domain name of your server, and replacing `RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v` by your choice of strong password:

```bash
brook wssserver --domain fq.domain.com -p RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v
```

You are returned to the root prompt (`#`).

At this stage you can exit your SSH session with the server.

```bash
exit
```

If you switched user, you will need to issue the `exit` command again.

Brook will still be runnning on your client. Do **CTRL**+**C** on your computer keyboard to stop the old Brook run on your client.  Then start it again, replacing `fq.domain.com` in the command below by the fully qualified domain name of your server, and replacing `RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v` by your choice of strong password:

```bash
brook wssclient -s wss://fq.domain.com:443 -p RRO7JteDFPYa8e5v --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080
```

Firefox should still be configured to use Brook as its proxy server. Retest your entire setup by visiting a site such as https://ipchicken.com.

![IP Chicken](/images/ipchicken1.png)

If everything is still working properly, you will see the IP address of your server.

When you have finished:

1. Do **CTRL**+**C** in your client terminal to stop the Brook WSS client
2. Set Firefox Network Settings back to using system proxy settings (i.e., none)
3. Note that Brook continues to run under `joker` on your server for next time

## Conclusion

You now have a working Brook server that you've tested with the Brook client.
