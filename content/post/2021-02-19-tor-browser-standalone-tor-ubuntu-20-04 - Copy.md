### Introduction

Tor Browser allows users in the non-free world to access the Internet. The standalone Tor program allows volunteers to support this access with relays, bridges, and onion services.

In this post you'll learn four methods for installing Tor on Ubuntu 20.04:

- installing Tor Browser
- installing standalone Tor from the Ubuntu repositories
- installing standalone Tor from the Tor Project repositories
- installing standalone Tor by compiling from source

You do not need to implement all four of these methods. You can simply choose the one that corresponds to your needs.

At the end of the tutorial, you'll have Tor Browser or standalone Tor installed on your Ubuntu Linux computer.

## Prerequisites

There are no special requirements for Tor Browser other than an up-to-date Ubuntu Linux desktop.

For standalone Tor, you will need to open your computer's firewall:

- for relays or onion services, open the `ORPort` defined in your `torrc` file
- for bridges, open the `ORPort` defined in your `torrc` file, unless you want to keep your bridge hidden and you set `AssumeReachable` in your `torrc`
- for bridges, open the `ServerTransportListenAddr` port
- if you want your server to mirror the directory, open the `DirPort` defined in your `torrc` file

## Method 1 — Installing Tor Browser

How you get the Tor Browser installer depends on where you are:

- If you are in the free world, download Tor Browser for 64-bit or 32-bit Linux from https://www.torproject.org/download/languages. The page offers installers for 16 languages.
- If you are not in the free world, send an email to gettor@torproject.org specifying your operating system and your locale in the body of the message. For example, you would put `windows es` for a Windows computer in the Spanish language.

The downloaded file will by default be in your Ubuntu `Downloads` directory. Open a terminal, and change into that directory:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

Determine the name of your downloaded file:

```
ls -l
```

The `-l` switch gives a long-format listing with details of each file on a separate line. We will use the example name of `tor-browser-linux64-10.0.10_en-US.tar.xz`.

Extract the files and directories from your compressed `tar` archive:

```bash
tar -xf tor-browser-linux64-10.0.10_en-US.tar.xz
```

It will take a few seconds to extract, as the archive is quite large (more than 80 MB). 

Determine the name of the extracted directory:

```
ls -l
```

We will use the example of `tor-browser_en-US`.

Change into the extracted directory. For example:

```bash
cd tor-browser_en-US
```

Run the script to register the application:

```bash
./start-tor-browser.desktop --register-app
```

You will see messages:

```
Launching './Browser/start-tor-browser --detach --register-app'...
Tor Browser has been registered as a desktop app for this user in ~/.local/share/applications/
```

Close the terminal. 

Press the apps button at the bottom left of your GNOME desktop to show your applications. Search for `tor`. You will see the Tor Browser application.

Double-click on the icon to launch Tor Browser.

Right-click on the icon in the favorites bar on the left of the GNOME desktop.

![GNOME desktop favorites bar](/images/tor-browser-favorites.png)

Select **Add to Favorites** to permanently add the Tor Browser to your favorites bar.

Now select the option that corresponds to your situation:

- Click **Connect** to connect to Tor directly.
- Click **Configure** to adjust network settings if you are in a country that censors Tor or if you are connecting from a private network that requires a proxy server.

It can take a few minutes to make the connection to the Tor network. You will then see the initial screen.

Links on the initial page show you where you can get more information on operating Tor Browser.

## Method 2 — Installing Standalone Tor from the Ubuntu Repositories

SSH into your server. Get your server software up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Install standalone Tor from the Ubuntu repositories:

```bash
sudo apt -y install tor
```

This installs Tor version 0.4.2.7. The service `tor@default` is running, and listening on port `9050`. The default `torrc` file is located at `/etc/tor/torrc`.

## Method 3 — Installing Standalone Tor from the Tor Project Repositories

SSH into your server. Get your server software up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Add the `apt-transport-https` package to allow fetching packages over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https
```

Edit your APT sources list, `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

At the bottom of the file, dd the Tor Project repositories:

```
deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
```

Write the file out to disk, and exit the editor.

Download and import the Tor Project signing key:

```bash
curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | sudo gpg --import
```

It is normal to see a message `no ultimately trusted keys found`:

```
gpg: key EE8CBC9E886DDD89: 83 signatures not checked due to missing keys
gpg: /root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key EE8CBC9E886DDD89: public key "deb.torproject.org archive signing key" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
```

Add the Tor Project GPG key to your APT sources keyring:

```bash
sudo gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -
```

You should see a response:

```
OK
```

Update your package lists and install Tor:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
```

At the time of writing, this installs Tor version 0.4.5.6. The service `tor@default` is running, and listening on port `9050`. The default `torrc` file is located at `/etc/tor/torrc`.

## Method 4 — Installing Standalone Tor by Compiling from Source

Compiling Tor from source will give you an up-to-date binary, but you will have to do more work than you would with a package.

Start by SSH-ing into your server. Get your server software up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Open a browser and visit https://www.torproject.org/download/tor. 

From that page, determine the latest release of Tor. We will use the example `0.4.5.6`.

Back in your SSH session with your server, download the source for that version. For example:

```bash
wget https://dist.torproject.org/tor-0.4.5.6.tar.gz
```

Extract the files and directories from the archive:

```bash
tar -xzf tor-0.4.5.6.tar.gz
```

Change into the extracted directory:

```bash
cd tor-0.4.5.6
```

Install the prerequisites for the compile:

```bash
sudo apt -y install build-essential libevent-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```
Then configure:

```bash
./configure
```

Various precompile checks are carried out, ending with messages:

```

Configure Line: ./configure

  WARNING:

```

Compile Tor from source:

```bash
make
```

The compile takes many minutes.

Once the compile has completed, install Tor into `/usr/local/`:

```bash
sudo make install
```

The Tor binary is in `/usr/local/bin/`. The GeoIP and GeoIP6 databases are in `/usr/local/share/tor`. The sample `torrc.sample` is in `/usr/local/etc/tor`.

Note that, in contrast to installing Tor from a package in the repositories, there is no Tor service running, and there are no Tor systemd service files. You can run `tor` from the command line, or you can create the systemd service files yourself.

If you want systemd service files, you can use as your model the multi-instance master `/usr/lib/systemd/system/tor.service` included with Ubuntu 20.04:

```
# This service is actually a systemd target,
# but we are using a service since targets cannot be reloaded.

And the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/tor@.service` instantiable service unit included with Ubuntu 20.04:

```

## Conclusion

You now have Tor Browser or standalone Tor installed on your Ubuntu Linux computer.

You can read the Tor documentation, including configuration instructions, on the [Tor Project website](https://www.torproject.org).
